## Motivation
In recent years, concerns over the impact of climate change have moved to the forefront of public discussion. Our group is interested in assessing how trends in chronic disease incidence at the state level have been impacted by air pollution and solar radiation. Air pollution is known to be associated with lung cancer and asthma, and UV radiation with skin cancer, but we want to illustrate these associations wtih contemporary data from diverse areas. We also seek to determine whether temperature and precipitation correlate with these chronic diseases as well.

## Intended final products
We intend to create a written report detailing the findings of our project. Additionally, we will create a github-supported repo and webpage with a dashboard of data visualization relating to our analysis. The dashboard will include asthma, lung cancer, and skin cancer incidence for selected states over a span of several years and the temperature, precipitation, air pollution, and UV radiation trends over the years for those states of interest. Finally, we will create a short screencast narrating our project. 

## Anticipated data sources
### State-level chronic disease data
- Maine: Maine DHHS (Division of Public Health Systems) - [Cancer](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/public-health-systems/data-research/vital-records/mcr/reports/index.htm) and [Asthma](https://www.maine.gov/dhhs/mecdc/phdata/sha/sha-details.shtml?respiratory)
- New York: New York Department of Health - [Cancer](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/) and [Asthma](https://apps.health.ny.gov/statistics/environmental/public_health_tracking/tracker/index.html#/asthmaCounty)
- Ohio: Ohio Department of Health Data and Statistics - [Cancer](https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/know-our-programs/ohio-cancer-incidence-surveillance-system/Data-Statistics) and [Asthma](https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/wcm/connect/gov/c2404854-2151-435c-969b-fbaf859aa527/Asthma-Hospital-Discharge-Report-2012.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&CONVERT_TO=url&CACHEID=ROOTWORKSPACE.Z18_K9I401S01H7F40QBNJU3SO1F56-c2404854-2151-435c-969b-fbaf859aa527-mERWA6T)

### Air pollution
CDC National Environmental Public Health Tracking [Dataset](https://ephtracking.cdc.gov/download)

### UV radiation

## Planned analyses, visualizations, coding challenges
### Visualization
- Map of UV radiation, air pollution, etc. in areas of interest over time
- Map of annual melanoma, lung cancer, and asthma incidence per capita 

### Regression models
- Air pollution as a predictor of lung cancer incidence
- UV radiation as a predictor of melanoma (skin cancer) incidence

### Coding and analytic challenges
Working with large datasets always provides certain challenges. We expect to face difficulties in working with data of different granularities. We already see that certain data sets show incidence proportions by county and others by the entire state. We also see certain data sets with different start and end years. We may struggle with finding appropriate visualization methods or have to plan for dealing with incomplete data. Additionally, we plan to use regressions and statistical learning techniques that may not be covered in class.

## Planned timeline
- November 12- Submit project proposal
- November 15- Zoom meeting to divide labor among group members
- November 22- complete data import and tidying
- November 29- complete visualization of data and first draft of webpage
- December 6- proofread, edit mistakes/errors, and complete webpage
- December 8- finish project report writing
- December 10- complete screencast recording and submit final project
