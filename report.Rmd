```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/planet_b.jpeg")
```

If you've spent time on social media in the last few years, you may have noticed
one particular topic trending often. Now, more than ever, discussions of climate 
change and its impacts are mainstream. As students in the School of Public Health,
our group was united by an interest in climate change and public health. We 
wanted to quantify the relationship between climate measure variables like 
particulate matter, ozone levels, and uv radiation, and see how they may impact 
health outcomes like asthma hospitalizations, lung cancer, and melanoma. 

### Related work: 

Some articles that inspired our research are:

- [Head waves and heat strokes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24823-0)

- [Precipitation, daylight, and depression](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165178109003618?casa_token=3nyJE_3V5AIAAAAA:k29sL6VeAxFiFXV4N7jjJ7oUNI75QJAGu82LI7Ii5_gKq6I5zwqxkZLNzq1Cy8df0H4yN56LaMM)

- [Hurricane Sandy flood exposure assessment](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0170965)



### Initial questions: 

In exploring our outcomes, we asked the following questions in getting to know
our data sets:

- What are the current incidence rates of lung cancer, melanoma, and asthma 
emergency room visits? Do these trends differ significantly at the county and
state levels?

- How have these rates changed by state over time?


In analyzing our exposures and how they impact our outcomes, we asked the
following:

- How do lung cancer age-adjusted incidence rates vary annually based on median 
particulate matter levels? Does this change from state to state?

- How do emergency department visits and/or hospitalization rates for asthma vary annually based on  
median particulate matter levels? Does this change from state to state?

- How do melanoma age-adjusted incidence rates vary annually based on uv or ozone
levels? Does this change from state to state?

- Is annual median particulate matter level a good predictor of lung cancer 
age-adjusted incidence rates? How does the regression change when state is added 
to the model?

- Is annual median ozone level or uv level a good predictor of melanoma 
age-adjusted incidence rates? How does the regression change when state is added 
to the model?

- Is annual median particulate matter level a good predictor of annual 
asthma-related emergency room visits or hospitalizations rates? How does the regression change when 
state is added to the model?


## Data: 

#### Exposures

Our [ozone data](https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-County-Level-Ozone-Concentrations-2001-2016/kmf5-t9yc) and our [air pollution data](https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-PM2-5-Concentrations-All-County-2001-2016/7vdq-ztk9) were both sourced from the CDC's National Environmental Public Health
Tracking website. 

#### Outcomes

For county level cancer outcomes, each state's data set was sourced from the [NIH State Cancer Profiles](https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/).

For state level outcomes, each data set was sourced directly from health 
departments of each respective state.

##### Asthma

  - [Ohio](https://odh.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/odh/know-our-programs/asthma-program)
  
  - [New York](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/environmental/public_health_tracking/about_pages/asthma/export)
  
  - [Pennsylvania](https://www.phaim1.health.pa.gov/EDD/WebForms/HospitalDischargeCntyStChrt.aspx)  
  
##### Melanoma
  
  - [Ohio](https://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/EDW/DataCatalog)
  
  - [New York](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/table2/tb2melanomanys.htm)
  
  - [Pennsylvania](https://www.phaim1.health.pa.gov/EDD/)
  
##### Lung Cancer
  
 - [Ohio](https://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/EDW/DataCatalog)

Next, we were able to merge all of our state level outcomes into one data set

#### Merged State Level Outcome Data

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# merging state level data for lung cancer

state_lc <- rbind(pa_cancer, oh_cancer, ny_cancer)

state_lc_wide = state_lc %>%
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = state,
    values_from = age_adjusted_incidence_rate) %>%
  rename(c("PA_AAIR" = "PA", "NY_AAIR" = "NY", "OH_AAIR" = "OH"))

write_csv(state_lc_wide, "./data/state_lc_wide.csv")


# Merge state-level data frames with bind_rows
state_melanoma_age_adjusted <- 
  bind_rows(nys_melanoma_age_adjusted,
            ohio_melanoma_age_adjusted,
            pa_melanoma_age_adjusted)

# read in longitudinal state data for lung and skin cancer

# longitudinal state level lung cancer data
state_lc_data = read_csv("./data/lung/state_lc_data.csv")

# longitudinal state level melanoma data
state_mel_data = read_csv("./data/incidence_melanoma_data/state_melanoma_age_adjusted.csv") %>%
  rename(c("outcome" = "cancer_type"))

# combine cancer outcome data
lc_mel_state = bind_rows(state_lc_data, state_mel_data) %>%
  select(state, year, outcome, age_adjusted_incidence_rate)

# Read in longitudinal state-level asthma data
# Rename and select columns
asthma_state <- read_csv(here::here("data", "asthma_state.csv")) %>%
  rename(age_adjusted_incidence_rate = rate) %>%
  select(state, year, outcome, age_adjusted_incidence_rate)

# Bind rows of longitudinal asthma and longitudinal cancer by state and arrange

lc_mel_asthma_state <- bind_rows(lc_mel_state, asthma_state) %>%
  arrange(state, year, outcome)


```

Then, we could do the same with our county-level outcomes to get a merged set.

## Exploratory analysis: 

Visualizations, summaries, and exploratory statistical analyses. Justify the steps you took, and show any major changes to your ideas.

### Preliminary visualizations of data

#### Asthma

Initial assessment of asthma data explored the two metric for measuring prevalence in the population, namely emergency department visits and hospitalizations due to asthma. **STILL WORKING ON THIS**

### Exposures and Outcome

### Spatial visualizations of exposures and outcomes

Once all the data was gathered for both exposures and outcomes of interest, we sought to visualize the data in a cross-sectional manner with incidence rates of outcomes plotted onto maps indicating the extent of exposures for a given year. In this case, we used data from 2016 (with the exception of UV dat which was not available and the 2015 data was used in its place). This was accomplished by first plotting maps with a gradient fill to indicate relative levels of the exposure (i.e UV radiation, particulate matter, or low-atomspheric ozone) at the county level. Bubble markers were then overlain with each bubble's size and shading indicating the relative incidence of outcomes (i.e. hospitalization due to asthma, melanoma incidence, and lung cancer incidence). These layers were then put into plot_ly via ggplotly for interactivity with each marker giving all available data for a given county.

The follow code chunk prepares the data frames for both the map and the data.

The plots are as follows:

```{r p_o3_lc, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p_o3_lc
```
**Summer 2016 mean atmospheric ozone concentration (in ppb) plotted on the map with markers for asthma hospitalization rates in 2016 (age-adjusted per 100,000 people)**

```{r p_o3_as, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p_o3_as
```
**Summer 2016 mean PM 2.5 (in µg/m^3^) plotted on the map with markers for lung cancer incidence rates in 2016 (age-adjusted per 100,000 people)**
```{r p_pm_lc, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p_pm_lc
```
**Summer 2016 mean PM 2.5 (in µg/m^3^) plotted on the map with markers for asthma hospitalization rates in 2016 (age-adjusted per 100,000 people)**
```{r p_pm_as, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p_pm_as
```
**Summer 2015 mean UV (in J/m^2^, erthemally weighted daily dose) plotted on the map with markers for melanoma incidence rates in 2016 (age-adjusted per 100,000 people)**
```{r p_uv_mel, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
p_uv_mel
```

There are no striking trends in the data but it is noted that some of the highest
hospitalization rates due to asthma are located in the NYC metropolitan area where 
PM2.5 and ozone concentrations were relatively high during the summer of 2016. 
However, lung cancer rates were grestest in Southern Ohio and Northern New York 
where there are low to moderate levels of ozone and PM2.5. Melanoma incidence 
rates for 2016 were overall higher in Ohio where there were also moderate to high
levels of UV radiation the year prior in 2015. 

These initial cross-sectional visualizations hint at possible correlations but further analyses are warranted to see the extent of associations between our exposures and outcomes of interest if they exist.


More extensive data visualizations and spatial analyses can be found on the 
[Health Outcomes Data](https://beeleeballin.github.io/p8105-final_project/health_outcomes_data.html)
and [Data Exploration: Map](https://beeleeballin.shinyapps.io/apuv_map/) pages.




## Additional analysis: 

In addition to the numerous data visualizations seen both in this report,  we did
extensive work on running regression models and seeing how our exposure data was
correlated to and could be used to predict our outcomes.


The following code was used to set up our outcome data for these models:

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

outcomes_state <- read_csv("data/lc_mel_asthma_state.csv")
outcomes_county <- read_csv("data/lc_mel_asthma_county.csv")
ap_uv <- read_csv("ap/ap_uv/apuv.csv")

#State-level analysis - fewer predictors
ap_uv_state_slim <- ap_uv %>%
  select(-c(countyfips, county,
            pm25_max_pred, pm25_mean_pred, pm25_pop_pred,
            o3_max_pred, o3_mean_pred, o3_pop_pred,
            i310, i305, i380, edr)) %>%
  group_by(state, year, season) %>%
  #Take medians across county for each season
  summarize(across(pm25_med_pred:edd, median)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = season, values_from = pm25_med_pred:edd)

#State-level analysis - more predictors
ap_uv_state <- ap_uv %>%
  select(-c(countyfips, county)) %>%
  group_by(state, year, season) %>%
  #Take medians across county for each season
  summarize(across(pm25_max_pred:i380, median)) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = season, values_from = pm25_max_pred:i380)

outcomes_wider_state <- outcomes_state %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = outcome, values_from = age_adjusted_incidence_rate)
  
state_analysis <- left_join(outcomes_wider_state, ap_uv_state_slim)


```

## Discussion: 

Generally, we can conclude from our spatial visualizations that the highest 
concentrations of lung cancer, skin cancer, and asthma hospitalizations in our
three-state observation window all resided in different areas. We observed high
asthma hospitalization rates in NYC, where moderate to high levels of particulate
matter and ozone were seen in the same year. Melanoma rates in Ohio were similarly
high, alongside the reasonably high rates of UV radiation. However, contrary to
expectation, we saw the highest rates of lung cancer in areas of Ohio and New York
State where rates of ozone and particulate matter were generally low.

More can be found from our models on the regression page, but the suspicion that they may be overfitted remains.



### Limitations to analyses

Although we focused our attention to three neighboring states, availability of 
surveillance data for chronic health conditions varies greatly across these three
states. These variations in data collection make it difficult for comparison 
across states, as the scales may not be comparable or the metric for measuring 
prevalence in the population may differ between states. For instance, asthma 
incidence can be reported with respect to acute cases as shown with emergency 
department visits or more specifically with rates of hospitalization due 
exclusively to asthma. Consequently, when comparing exposures as potential risk
factors for asthma across the states and counties, we were limited to only 
looking at hospitalizations because publicly available Pennsylvania data only 
reported on hospitalizations and not emergency department visits. Similarly, 
surveillance data may not collect demographic data that have been shown to be 
moderators of the health outcomes. For instance, gender, race, and ethnicity have
been reported in  academic literature as important factors influencing differences
observed in incidence rates of lung cancer globally. 

These important moderators have been discussed not only in academic literature
(e.g., [Schabeth et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1177/107327481602300405),), [Meza et al. (2015)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0121323), and [O'Keeffe et al. (2018)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2018-021611)
)
but also in [reports by health organizations like the American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/research/cancer-facts-statistics/global.html)) 
and in [data visualizations by the World Health Organization](https://gco.iarc.fr/overtime/en).
However, not all counties or states may report these relevant data as routinely if at all 
to provide a complete picture of the disease incidence.
