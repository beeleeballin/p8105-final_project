## Motivation: 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="65%", fig.cap="Climate Change", fig.align = 'center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./images/climate2.png")
```

If you've spent time on social media in the last few years, you may have noticed
one particular topic trending often. Now, more than ever, discussions of climate 
change and its impacts are mainstream. As students in the School of Public Health,
our group was united by an interest in climate change and public health. We 
wanted to quantify the relationship between climate measure variables like 
particulate matter and ozone levels, and see how they may impact health outcomes 
like asthma, lung cancer, and melanoma.

### Initial questions: 

In exploring our outcomes, we asked the following questions in getting to know
our data sets:

- What are the current incidence rates of lung cancer, melanoma, and asthma 
emergency room visits? Do these trends differ significantly at the county and
state levels?

- How have these rates changed by state over time?


In analyzing our exposures and how they impact our outcomes, we asked the
following:

- How do lung cancer age-adjusted incidence rates vary annually based on median 
particulate matter levels? Does this change from state to state?

- How do emergency department visit rates for asthma vary annually based on  
median particulate matter levels? Does this change from state to state?

- How do melanoma age-adjusted incidence rates vary annually based on median 
ozone levels? Does this change from state to state?

- Is annual median particulate matter level a good predictor of lung cancer 
age-adjusted incidence rates? How does the regression change when state is added 
to the model?

- Is annual median ozone level a good predictor of melanoma age-adjusted incidence 
rates? How does the regression change when state is added to the model?

- Is annual median particulate matter level a good predictor of annual 
asthma-related emergency room visit rates? How does the regression change when 
state is added to the model?


## Data: 

**Exposures**

Our [ozone data](https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-County-Level-Ozone-Concentrations-2001-2016/kmf5-t9yc) and our [air pollution data](https://data.cdc.gov/Environmental-Health-Toxicology/Daily-PM2-5-Concentrations-All-County-2001-2016/7vdq-ztk9) were both sourced from the CDC's National Environmental Public Health
Tracking website. 

**Outcomes**

For county level cancer outcomes, each state's data set was sourced from the [NIH State Cancer Profiles](https://statecancerprofiles.cancer.gov/).

For state level outcomes, each data set was sourced directly from health 
departments of each respective state.

-  **Asthma ED**
  ?????
  
-  **Melanoma**
  
  - [Ohio](https://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/EDW/DataCatalog)
  
  - [New York](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/table2/tb2melanomanys.htm)
  
  - [Pennsylvania](https://www.phaim1.health.pa.gov/EDD/)
  
-  **Lung Cancer**
  
 - [Ohio](https://publicapps.odh.ohio.gov/EDW/DataCatalog)
  
 - [New York](https://www.health.ny.gov/statistics/cancer/registry/table2/tb2lungnys.htm)

A significant amount of cleaning was required, as can be seen in the code chunks below:

**exposures data**
**NEEDS CODE CHUNKS**
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


```


**county level outcomes data**
**NEEDS CODE CHUNKS**
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}


```

Then, we were able to merge both of our exposures into one data set, *apuv*,
with the following variables:

**NEEDS CODE CHUNKS**

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}



```


  * `Year`. Year
  
  * `Countyfips`. County-level unique identifier
  
  * `County`. Name of county

  * `State`. 2-character abbreviation of state name
  
  * `Season`. Period of year in which data was collected
  
  * `Pm25_max_pred`.
  
  * `Pm25_med_pred`.

  * `Pm25_mean_pred`.
  
  * `Pm25_pop_pred`. 
  
  * `O3_max_pred`.
  
  * `O3_med_pred`.

  * `O3_mean_pred`.
  
  * `O3_pop_pred`.
  
  * `Edd`.
  
  * `Edr`.
  
  * `I305`. 
  
  * `I310`.
  
  * `I324`.
  
  * `I380`.


Next, we were able to merge all of our state level outcomes into one data set,  *lc_mel_asthma_state*:
**NEEDS CODE CHUNK**

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}



```

Then, we could do the same with our county-level outcomes to get our *lc_mel_asthma_county* data set
**NEEDS CODE CHUNK**

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

```


**lc_mel_asthma_county**

  * `state`. 2-letter abbreviation
  
  * `county`. name of county
  
  * `outcome`. type of outcome (lung cancer, melanoma, asthma ED visit)
  
  * `age_adjusted_incidence_rate`. per 100,000
  
  * `fips`. county-level unique identifier

**lc_mel_asthma_state**

  * `state`. 2-letter abbreviation
  
  * `year`. Year
  
  * `outcome`. type of outcome (lung cancer, melanoma, asthma ED visit)
  
  * `age_adjusted_incidence_rate`. per 100,000
